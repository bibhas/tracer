This library is free, and will stay free but needs your support to sustain its development. There are lots of [**new features**](doc/markdown/roadmap.md) and maintenance to do. If you work for a company using **doctest** or have the means to do so, please consider financial support.

---------

The **doctest** library is inspired by the [**```unittest {}```**](https://wiki.dlang.org/Unittest) functionality of the **D** programming language and **Python**'s [**docstrings**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring) - tests can be considered a form of documentation and should be able to reside near the production code which they test.

A complete example with a self-registering test that compiles to an executable looks like this:

![cover-example](doc/data/cover_888px_wide.png)

Note how a standard C++ operator for equality comparison is used - **doctest** has one core [**assertion macro**](doc/markdown/assertions.md) (it also has for *less than*, *equals*, *greater than*...) - yet the full expression is decomposed and the left and right values are logged.

It is modeled after [**Catch**](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) which is currently the most popular alternative for testing in C++ - check out [**the differences**](doc/markdown/faq.md#how-is-doctest-different-from-catch).

---------

There are many C++ testing frameworks - [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch), [Boost.Test](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html), [UnitTest++](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp), [cpputest](https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest), [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and many [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#C.2B.2B).

What makes **doctest** different is that it is ultra light on compile times (by [**orders of magnitude**](doc/markdown/benchmarks.md#cost-of-including-the-header)) and is unintrusive.

The **key** differences between it and other testing libraries are:
- Ultra light - [**below 10ms**](doc/markdown/benchmarks.md#cost-of-including-the-header) of compile time overhead for including the header in a source file
- The [**fastest possible**](doc/markdown/benchmarks.md#cost-of-an-assertion-macro) assertion macros - 50k asserts can compile for under 30 seconds (even under 10 sec)
- [**Subcases**](doc/markdown/tutorial.md#test-cases-and-subcases) - an intuitive way to share common setup and teardown code for test cases (alternative to fixtures)
- Offers a way to remove **everything** testing-related from the binary with the [**```DOCTEST_CONFIG_DISABLE```**](doc/markdown/configuration.md#doctest_config_disable) identifier
- Doesn't pollute the global namespace (everything is in the ```doctest``` namespace) and doesn't drag **any** headers with it
- Doesn't produce any warnings even on the [**most aggressive**](scripts/common.cmake#L71) warning levels for **MSVC**/**GCC**/**Clang**
- Very [**portable and well tested**](doc/markdown/features.md#extremely-portable) C++98 - per commit tested on CI with over 220 different builds (valgrind, sanitizers...)
- Just one header and no external dependencies apart from the C/C++ standard library

This allows the framework to be used in more ways than any other - tests can be written directly in the production code!

- This makes the barrier for writing tests **much lower** - you don't have to: **1.** make a separate source file **2.** include a bunch of stuff in it **3.** add it to the build system and **4.** add it to source control - You can just write the tests for a class or a piece of functionality at the bottom of its source file - or even header file!
- Tests in the production code can be thought of as documentation or up-to-date comments - showing how an API is used
- Testing internals that are not exposed through the public API and headers becomes easier!
- [**Test-driven development**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) in C++ has never been easier!

The library can be used like any other if you don't like the idea of mixing production code and tests - check out the [**features**](doc/markdown/features.md)

Contributing
------------

Support the development of the project with donations! There is a list of planned features which are all important and big - see the [**roadmap**](doc/markdown/roadmap.md). I took a break from working in the industry to make open source software so every cent is a big deal.

If you work for a company using doctest or have the means to do so, please consider financial support.
